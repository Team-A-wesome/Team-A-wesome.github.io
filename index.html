<div>
  <h3 id="africa">Africa</h3>
  <p>Africa is home to the African Wild dog. These dogs are probably more social than you are, as they hand out i packs on the daily. Unlike most pack animals, Its the females that bounce to start their own pack once they come of age. Sadly, these hardcore carnicores are on the endangered list. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="asia">Asia</h3>
  <p>Asia, particularly japan, is the birthplace of the Shiba Inu. This meme machine is quite agile, and boasts a unique temperment when compared to other japenese breeds. Cutest little side fact: Shiba Inu is sometimes translated as Little Brushwood Dog.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="europe">Europe</h3>
  <p>Remeber that movie with Cats & Dogs, where there was a secret war between the two species unknown to us people? That movies star, Lou, is Europe's top dog breed: The Beagle. Beagles were bread to hunt, and what they lack in size, they make up for in speed and smell. While intelligent, these dogs tend to have a one track mind, and at the end of the dag make for great pets. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="south_america">South America</h3>
  <p>Take a trip over to South America and you'll find the Fila Brasileiro, also known as the Brazilian Mastiff! These dogs are expert trackers, and when provoked can be very agressive. They make for great hunters that can lock down their target untill the hunter arives. Unfortunaly, due to how aggresive this breed can be, many countries have banned it from being kept as a pet, so don't expect to see them around often. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="north_america">North America</h3>
  <p>Cover your ears, becuase this North American breed from Mexico might yapp them off. The Chihuaha, who's orgins are placed in Mexico, is generally a tiny breed, that has found a lot of popularity in the United States. Their breed comes in a wide variety of appearances with due to differnences in coats, head shapes, eye sets, and ear sizes. Generally if you have small children, you should stay away from the Chihuahua. The Chihuahua will be your forever small child.  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="antartica">Antarctica</h3>
  <p>Antarctica is home to the white breasted black feathered dog. These dogs love the water and survive on a diet of krill, fish, and squid. They spend half of their lives on land and the other half in the water! Some people might say this breed belongs in the bird family, but don't let the haters fool you. </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="australia">Australia</h3>
  <p>Last but not least is Autralia's Autralian Cattle Dog! Originally breed for droving cattle across long distances of crazy land (I mean it is Autralia after all.), the cattle dog finds itself an energetic and intelligent pet in many house hold. They love to heard other dog and childrend, and will do so by biting, so they dont make the best companions for a yound family. The breed showcases two beautiful coat distinctions in both red and blue colors. It's otften called a Red or Blue Heeler! </p>
